"README.md":"# MRIQC derivatives of the gallery of horror\n\n## Summary\nThe so called \"gallery of horror\" is a collection of very bad quality functional and structural T1-weighted MRI images corrupted by clear artifacts. This collection has been put together for educating researchers on the quality control process at the occasion of the OHBM educational courses 2018 \"Reusing Public Neuroimaging Datasets\".\nHere we provide the derivatives of MRIQC 21.0.0rc2 (the latest pre-release at the moment of writing) run on this collection of data ([Esteban et al., 2017](http://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0184661)). The derivatives contain both the MRIQC individual visual reports as well as the automatically computed image quality metrics (IQMs). Those IQMs can be found in the JSON files in the subject folders. \n\n## Downloading the data\n### Using DataLad\n\nMake sure that datalad is installed on your computer. Create an account on gin and upload your public SSH key to your gin profile. Then clone the data repository using\n```bash\ndatalad install -g git@gin.g-node.org:/cprovins/mriqc-horror-galery-derivatives\n```\nSee the *DataLad* documentation for details.\n\n### Using gin\n\nCreate an account on gin and download the *gin* client. On your computer, log in using\n```bash\ngin login\n```\n\nClone the repository using:\n```bash\ngin get cprovins/mriqc-horror-galery-derivatives\n```\n\nLarge data files will not be downloaded automatically. To get them, use\n```bash\ngin get-content <filename>\n```\n\nDownloaded large files will be locked (read-only). You must unlock the files using\n```bash\ngin unlock <filename>\n```\n\nTo remove the contents of a large file again, use\n```bash\ngin lock <filename>\ngin remove-content <filename>\n```\n\nSee [here](https://github.com/G-Node/gin-cli/wiki/Help) for detailed information on how to use *gin*.\n\n\n### Using git annex\n\nMake sure git and git-annex are installed on your computer. Create an account on gin and upload your public SSH key to your gin profile. Then clone the repository using\n```bash\ngit clone git@gin.g-node.org:/cprovins/mriqc-horror-galery-derivatives\n```\n\nLarge data files will not be downloaded automatically. To get them, use\n```bash\ngit annex get <filename>\n```\n\nDownloaded large files will be locked (read-only). You must unlock the files using\n```bash\ngit annex unlock <filename>\n```\n\nTo remove the contents of a large file again, use\n```bash\ngit annex --force lock <filename>\ngit annex drop <filename>\n```\n\nSee the *git annex* documentation for details.\n\n\n### Using the web browser\n\nDownload the latest release as a zip file by clicking on *Releases* on the main page at https://gin.g-node.org/cprovins/mriqc-horror-galery-derivatives. This zip file will contain all small (text) files only, while large data files will not be downloaded automatically and an empty placeholder will be put in their place. To get the full content of such a large file , download these files individually as needed from the web interface by clicking on them in the repository browser.\n\n## Repository structure\nThe individual MRIQC reports are html-format files in the root directory. These can be opened using any web-browser. There is also a folder for each participant containing a json file listing the IQMs and their values for each scan. Overall, the derivatives are organised following the BIDS standard.\n\n## Related Publications\n* Esteban O, Birman D, Schaer M, Koyejo OO, Poldrack RA, Gorgolewski KJ.
