"LICENSE":"Open Data Commons – Public Domain Dedication & Licence (PDDL)\n*************************************************************\n\nPreamble\n========\n\nThe Open Data Commons – Public Domain Dedication & Licence is a document\nintended to allow you to freely share, modify, and use this work for any\npurpose and without any restrictions. This licence is intended for use on\ndatabases or their contents (\"data\"), either together or individually.\n\nMany databases are covered by copyright. Some jurisdictions, mainly in Europe,\nhave specific special rights that cover databases called the \"sui generis\"\ndatabase right. Both of these sets of rights, as well as other legal rights\nused to protect databases and data, can create uncertainty or practical\ndifficulty for those wishing to share databases and their underlying data but\nretain a limited amount of rights under a \"some rights reserved\" approach to\nlicensing as outlined in the Science Commons Protocol for Implementing Open\nAccess Data. As a result, this waiver and licence tries to the fullest extent\npossible to eliminate or fully license any rights that cover this database and\ndata. Any Community Norms or similar statements of use of the database or data\ndo not form a part of this document, and do not act as a contract for access or\nother terms of use for the database or data.\n\nThe position of the recipient of the work\n\nBecause this document places the database and its contents in or as close as\npossible within the public domain, there are no restrictions or requirements\nplaced on the recipient by this document. Recipients may use this work\ncommercially, use technical protection measures, combine this data or database\nwith other databases or data, and share their changes and additions or keep\nthem secret. It is not a requirement that recipients provide further users with\na copy of this licence or attribute the original creator of the data or\ndatabase as a source. The goal is to eliminate restrictions held by the\noriginal creator of the data and database on the use of it by others.\n\nThe position of the dedicator of the work\n\nCopyright law, as with most other law under the banner of \"intellectual\nproperty\", is inherently national law. This means that there exists several\ndifferences in how copyright and other intellectual property rights can be\nrelinquished, waived or licensed in the many legal jurisdictions of the world.\nThis is despite much harmonisation of minimum levels of protection. The\ninternet and other communication technologies span these many disparate legal\njurisdictions and thus pose special difficulties for a document relinquishing\nand waiving intellectual property rights, including copyright and database\nrights, for use by the global community. Because of this feature of\nintellectual property law, this document first relinquishes the rights and\nwaives the relevant rights and claims. It then goes on to license these same\nrights for jurisdictions or areas of law that may make it difficult to\nrelinquish or waive rights or claims.\n\nThe purpose of this document is to enable rightsholders to place their work\ninto the public domain. Unlike licences for free and open source software, free\ncultural works, or open content licences, rightsholders will not be able to\n\"dual license\" their work by releasing the same work under different licences.\nThis is because they have allowed anyone to use the work in whatever way they\nchoose. Rightsholders therefore can't re-license it under copyright or database\nrights on different terms because they have nothing left to license. Doing so\ncreates truly accessible data to build rich applications and advance the\nprogress of science and the arts.\n\nThis document can cover either or both of the database and its contents (the\ndata). Because databases can have a wide variety of content – not just factual\ndata – rightsholders should use the Open Data Commons – Public Domain\nDedication & Licence for an entire database and its contents only if everything\ncan be placed under the terms of this document. Because even factual data can\nsometimes have intellectual property rights, rightsholders should use this\nlicence to cover both the database and its factual data when making material\navailable under this document; even if it is likely that the data would not be\ncovered by copyright or database rights. \n\nRightsholders can also use this document to cover any copyright or database\nrights claims over only a database, and leave the contents to be covered by\nother licences or documents. They can do this because this document refers to\nthe \"Work\", which can be either – or both – the database and its contents. As a\nresult, rightsholders need to clearly state what they are dedicating under this\ndocument when they dedicate it.\n\nJust like any licence or other document dealing with intellectual property,\nrightsholders should be aware that one can only license what one owns. Please\nensure that the rights have been cleared to make this material available under\nthis document.\n\nThis document permanently and irrevocably makes the Work available to the\npublic for any use of any kind, and it should not be used unless the\nrightsholder is prepared for this to happen. \n\n\nPart I: Introduction\n====================\n\nThe Rightsholder (the Person holding rights or claims over the Work) agrees as\nfollows:\n\n1 Definitions of Capitalised Words\n----------------------------------\n\n\"Copyright\" – Includes rights under copyright and under neighbouring rights and\nsimilarly related sets of rights under the law of the relevant jurisdiction\nunder Section 6.4.\n\n\"Data\" – The contents of the Database, which includes the information,\nindependent works, or other material collected into the Database offered under\nthe terms of this Document. \n\n\"Database\" – A collection of Data arranged in a systematic or methodical way\nand individually accessible by electronic or other means offered under the\nterms of this Document. \n\n\"Database Right\" – Means rights over Data resulting from the Chapter III (\"sui\ngeneris\") rights in the Database Directive (Directive 96/9/EC of the European\nParliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of\ndatabases)  and any future updates as well as any similar rights available in\nthe relevant jurisdiction under Section 6.4. \n\n\"Document\" – means this relinquishment and waiver of rights and claims and back\nup licence agreement. \n\n\"Person\" – Means a natural or legal person or a body of persons corporate or\nincorporate.\n\n\"Use\" –  As a verb, means doing any act that is restricted by Copyright or\nDatabase Rights whether in the original medium or any other; and includes\nmodifying the Work as may be technically necessary to use it in a different\nmode or format.

The Rightsholder intends for their relinquishment to cover all present and\n future rights in the Work under Copyright and Database Rights, whether they are\n vested or contingent rights, and that this relinquishment of rights covers all\n their heirs and successors.\n\nThe above relinquishment of rights applies worldwide and includes media and\nformats now known or created in the future.\n\n3.2 Waiver of rights and claims in Copyright and Database Rights when Section\n    3.1 dedication inapplicable.\n\nIf the dedication in Section 3.1 does not apply in the relevant jurisdiction\nunder Section 6.4, the Rightsholder waives any rights and claims that the\nRightsholder may have or acquire in the future over the Work in:\n\n a. Copyright; and\n\n b. Database Rights.\n\nTo the extent possible in the relevant jurisdiction, the above waiver of rights\nand claims applies worldwide and includes media and formats now known or\ncreated in the future.

"README.md":"Emotion ratings collected in twelve italian participants while watching the Forrest Gump movie\n(edited version adopted in studyforrest.org project). Subjects continuously reported the\nintensity of their own emotional experience on a scale ranging from 0 to 100 for the six basic\nemotions (happiness, surprise, fear, sadness, anger and disgust). For further details, please\nrefer to \"Emotionotopy in the Human Right Temporo-Parietal Cortex\" paper\n(DOI: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-13599-z) and to http://osf.io/tzpdf\n\n## DataLad datasets and how to use them\n\nThis repository is a [DataLad](https://www.datalad.org/) dataset. It provides\nfine-grained data access down to the level of individual files, and allows for\ntracking future updates. In order to use this repository for data retrieval,\n[DataLad](https://www.datalad.org/) is required. It is a free and\nopen source command line tool, available for all major operating\nsystems, and builds up on Git and [git-annex](https://git-annex.branchable.com/)\nto allow sharing, synchronizing, and version controlling collections of\nlarge files. You can find information on how to install DataLad at\n[handbook.datalad.org/en/latest/intro/installation.html](http://handbook.datalad.org/en/latest/intro/installation.html).\n\n### Get the dataset\n\nA DataLad dataset can be `cloned` by running\n\n```\ndatalad clone <url>\n```\n\nOnce a dataset is cloned, it is a light-weight directory on your local machine.\nAt this point, it contains only small metadata and information on the\nidentity of the files in the dataset, but not actual *content* of the\n(sometimes large) data files.\n\n### Retrieve dataset content\n\nAfter cloning a dataset, you can retrieve file contents by running\n\n```\ndatalad get <path/to/directory/or/file>`\n```\n\nThis command will trigger a download of the files, directories, or\nsubdatasets you have specified.\n\nDataLad datasets can contain other datasets, so called *subdatasets*.\nIf you clone the top-level dataset, subdatasets do not yet contain\nmetadata and information on the identity of files, but appear to be\nempty directories. In order to retrieve file availability metadata in\nsubdatasets, run\n\n```\ndatalad get -n <path/to/subdataset>\n```\n\nAfterwards, you can browse the retrieved metadata to find out about\nsubdataset contents, and retrieve individual files with `datalad get`.\nIf you use `datalad get <path/to/subdataset>`, all contents of the\nsubdataset will be downloaded at once.\n\n### Stay up-to-date\n\nDataLad datasets can be updated. The command `datalad update` will\n*fetch* updates and store them on a different branch (by default\n`remotes/origin/master`). Running\n\n```\ndatalad update --merge\n```\n\nwill *pull* available updates and integrate them in one go.\n\n### Find out what has been done\n\nDataLad datasets contain their history in the ``git log``.\nBy running ``git log`` (or a tool that displays Git history) in the dataset or on\nspecific files, you can find out what has been done to the dataset or to individual files\nby whom, and when.\n\n### More information\n\nMore information on DataLad and how to use it can be found in the DataLad Handbook at\n[handbook.datalad.org](http://handbook.datalad.org/en/latest/index.html). The chapter\n\"DataLad datasets\" can help you to familiarize yourself with the concept of a dataset.\n",
